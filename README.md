# khoj-sync
Forked from https://gist.github.com/dj311/fad8666c361261ed4af68285a233250a. Add some new features like support api-keys, sync once, set EXCLUDED DIRs, specify dirs to sync from command line or ini file, list files to sync, sync a file list, and so on. Now it is a powerful sync tool for khoj.
